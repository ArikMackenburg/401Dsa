# Features
+ Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
+ Create a BinaryTree class
  + Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
+ Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

+ Create a BinarySearchTree class
  + Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
  + Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
## Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

+ Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
+ Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
+ Can successfully add a left child and right child to a single root node
+ Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
+ Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
+ Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal
+ Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

Stretch Goal
Create a new branch called k-ary-tree, and, using the resources available to you online, implement a k-ary tree, where each node can have any number of children.

## Breadth-first Traversal.
### Specifications
Feature Tasks
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.
## Example
#### Input

Output
